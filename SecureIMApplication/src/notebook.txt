
I combined the chat client solution with the one that you did to create this secure client.
 The chat server is that of the solution with minor modifications.

It works poorly at best:
Occasionally, the server will accept one line read from the client, and return it. the rest of the time, the server does not accept info.

My goal:
To get the clients working before implementing the security aspect.
