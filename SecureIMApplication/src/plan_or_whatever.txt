BACKGROUND:
Client reads server connection information (IP, ports, etc) from a configuration file (public key)
Upon starting, client immediately attempts to connect to the server
User is prompted at startup for username/password
Server holds a table of username/ password-hashes, and their online status (on/off)
	Server reads from a configuration file
		Writes to file when changing status:
			Perhaps server stores UNAME | PWD-HASH | ROW | STATUS (online/offline)
			(I understand poorly the file.write in java, added "row" to make easy .write())
			Then changes the last bit.

PRESENT:
User opens client
Client reads from the configuration file
Client immediately attempts to connect to server
Server requests username + password
Note: username should be max 16bits or something, password 8 bits. so we can just compare
	uname+passwdhash to the first 16+8 bits in the server tables.
Server verifies the username+password combo 
	If good, then		
		1.) toggle "on" for this user
		2.) allow user the privilege to use "list" And "send USER MESSAGE"
	Else, return exception "incorrect combo"
If a user is online, allow send to them.
	(Still thinking about the send protocol)â€¦
	Will get back to you on this one
